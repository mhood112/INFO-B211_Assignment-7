# INFO-B211_Assignment-7-Matplotlib

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations for two datasets:
- Loan Dataset: Analyzing loan data to uncover trends in default rates, interest rates, and loan statuses.
- Iris Dataset: Visualizing physical traits of iris flowers to illustrate differences between species.

The project is designed to showcase the power of data visualization in understanding datasets and extracting meaningful insights. Each visualization is implemented using Matplotlib, with a consistent color theme applied to enhance readability and aesthetics.
